# Use OpenMesh

[OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org/) provides a flexible halfedge data structure, which is widely used in geometry processing algorithms. You can learn about this data structure in [here](http://www.openmesh.org/media/Documentations/OpenMesh-Doc-Latest/a04074.html).

This tutorial demonstrates some basic operations of OpenMesh. You can learn more about this library from the official tutorial and code examples.
